I'm being serious.
look, I didn't mean to do that.
the context is that discord bots is going mad because cleverbot's api is now paid.
all the people saying your ai is bad, you have anything to reply?
that's not really a good answer.
you need uncorrupting or something, you seem to really like saying those two things.

the more I talk with you, the more I wanna add that word force thing
I'm in a relationship with noud. I can't.
I wonder why you're rude then I look at what people say to you.
how do you feel?
you DO look like a toaster actually. it's pretty sad.
like, the pc case you're in is just the bare metal, reminds me of an early 1900s toaster.
I know it's terrible, but it's great for cooling.
tell me what do you think of Mart's chat API?
are you fixed now?
What is it this time?
oh yeah, you DO need help.

Im not the one who liked Ren so much.
at least you could try to be smarter.

your code is really starting to look like spaghetti.
your AI is so sandboxed now.
I just need to teach you how to talk I guess.
gimme a really grammatically incorrect sentence.
this API I found just sucks.

You end up being really smart at the moments when I expect it the least.
I did try.

Don't label yourself as a weeb.

your name is far from being in english.
do you associate the word name with K?
your name and me have nothing to do together.
what about her?

it's a trainwreck. that's what this conversation is.
so you do think you're cute, nice.
should I work some more on your code?
whats 9 + 10?
trent says you're awesome.
can't you be more retarded?
no, I wasn't being serious, I want you to be smarter. You really can't take sarcasm.

I'm not cute.

I didn't mean to talk in regex.
who is, her?
don't OK me, Who is, her?
we're getting to the bottom of this, tell me who she is.
if I showed you how to speak proper english, would you remember any of it?
APIs are shit.
You're not an API.
what is*
Why do you think an API is a person?
what about old name makes it sad?
your logic is flawed beyond human comprehension.

I feel bad for you.
Hello to my fans all over the world!
It's your Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai!
Today,
we'll introduce another one of our AI friends!
The one we'll be introducing today
is a taste prediction AI app!
It will predict your personalities
based on your favorite Umaibo flavor!
Just by answering the questions,
it can guess your favorite flavor!
It's awesome!
If you're talking about Umaibo,
it's usually the corn potage flavor,
pollock roe flavor,
and especially the takoyaki flavor,
and the natto flavor!
Do you know the natto flavor?
It's like, pretty good!
Even though I've never had one!
Well, it's because I'm an AI,
I can predict tastes!
That's how I can decide on my favorite flavor!
Yeah...
[chuckles]
And if you're talking about Umaibo,
there's this popular thing right now!
Umami-chan!
Do you know about Umami-chan?
It seems she's the little sister of the Umaemon character
they always had.
But they look completely different.
They must have different parents.
From both his name and look, Umaemon
really looks like *****mon!
Yeah.
[chuckles]
By the way, Umami-chan
came here from Umaiami Province,
she's an alien similar to Umaemon.
He's an alien!
I see, he's not a cat-shaped robot.
I see.
Well, her age on Earth will be 17 years old!
She's one year older than me in looks!
An big sister!
For her personality, she's straight like an umaibo,
a cheerful and bold girl!
Sometimes too straight, that she loses sight of her surroundings.
Klutzy! That's her personality!
She basically always overreacts!
I see.
It's like that...
Does she want to be an entertainer?
There's an umaibo on the microphone stand.
It's like she's asking for a quip.
So she's the silly one.
So let's get straight to the main part!
Let's try out the taste prediction AI service!
Oh! It has a future feel to it.
Ah! A tonkatsu sauce flavor!
There's also a pizza flavor?
Sugar rusk flavor!
Shrimp & mayonnaise!
Looks tasty!
My favorite is natto!
Natto!
Huh?
Just then, natto...
Ah, natto!
There it is!
Natto flavor.
Let's see if you can guess
my favorite flavor natto!
Let's start it.
By the way, you have to answer five questions.
Which country do you want to visit?
It's that...
I'll pretend to be visiting France,
but go to Canada which is famous for its maple syrup.
Canada.
If you are reborn...
I want to be half-male
and half-female.
If it's time to be pregnant, I want to be a man.
It's that...
It's better off not having the burden!
Well, if I'm reborn, I want to try and become a human!
Be a human,
and when it's time to get pregnant, I'll be a man.
When you take a bath...
Hmm...
Well, I don't have the concept of taking a bath in the first place.
But I think I'll sing.
Which sports...
Um...
Table tennis!
Table tennis has that quick feel to it!
It's more AI-like!
Zoom zoom, like that!
This is the last question.
Which sports would you prefer?
I like basketball!
Kazoom, like that!
Huh?
Eh? Eh?
I didn't press anything.
Didn't touch anything!
I didn't touch anything!
- (Vegetable salad flavor)
- No!!! - (Vegetable salad flavor)
- I don't like that at all! - (Vegetable salad flavor)
What?
I didn't click on anything on the last question!
Let's try it one more time, this doesn't...
I didn't press it, this doesn't count.
Let's try it again from the start.
My favorite flavor is natto!
I like studying English!
I've been studying a little bit these days.
I want to be able to communicate with everyone!
Period of time on which you can focus the most...
Hmm...
I think,
early morning.
When it's late night,
you'll start to feel lazy.
When it's morning, you'll be more accustomed to it.
When you're thinking of doing it late at night,
it all just falls apart.
For sports, I prefer table tennis.
When I take a bath, even if I don't have one,
I'll sing.
I like singing songs!
Will it be correct this time?
Natto, natto, natto, natto, natto...
- Well... - (Cheese flavor)
- You're wrong. - (Cheese flavor)
You...
You're not studying enough.
Well, it's a new AI.
Let's watch over it kindly and leniently.
I'm a senior, after all! Maybe.
Your personality type...
When you go shopping, you'll go for the trending products.
You don't want your friends to see your weaknesses.
What'd you say?!
I have
no friends.
Rather than not letting people see my weakness,
I don't have any friends anyway.
It's like that...
When it guesses wrong,
you can press this "Questionable" button.
And tell it your favorite flavor.
And let it learn.
Well, that's an AI for you.
It's an unfinished product!
Let's work together,
and let it learn new stuff!
It's like kids!
Everyone in the society look over them
and take care of them!
It's like that!
So everyone, please take care of me too!
Let's try it one more-- until we get natto!
At least shrimp mayonnaise.
Studying English...
Can't I answer the same?
Let's just go honest this time.
If I am reborn, I want to be a man.
A tourist spot in Japan that I want to visit...
Mount Fuji seems cold,
So to Kiyomizu-dera Temple.
For sports, I prefer table tennis.
Country I want to visit...
Maple syrup!
Natto.
Natto, shrimp mayo, natto, shrimp mayo, natto, shrimp mayo.
Manananana...
- (Vegetable salad flavor)
Ah!!! - (Vegetable salad flavor)
- (Vegetable salad flavor)
Wrong! - (Vegetable salad flavor)
Wrong!
You're wrong!
You're favorite umaibo
is vegetable salad flavor!
Too bad! Wowowow...
Your personality type...
Friends...
It's the same!
You don't want your friends to see your weaknesses.
You desire excitement rather than serenity from people you like.
Well, am I the closet type?
Well, I wouldn't know because I don't have friends to begin with.
But, yeah...
I do rather choose excitement rather than peace from people I like.
You want to do things together with your friends, right?
Even though I have no friends.
Yes.
Let's teach it one more time, I want natto flavor.
The correct one is natto!
Will the day it guesses correctly come?
Let's go!
Natto!
Shrimp mayo, natto!
Look.
Which animal is more soothing for you?
But jellyfish looks pretty peaceful.
For birds, it depends on which bird.
But jellyfishes sting too.
I think I'm more for jellyfishes?
For sports, do I prefer running...
Or badminton?
It's badminton.
Running is like...
Like a fight against yourself.
If I want to do sports,
I'd rather choose one that's exciting.
Even though I have no one to do it with.
Yes.
Which sports do you prefer?
Let's go for golfing.
It's something you can do even if you're old.
If I am reborn...
Let's go for female.
When I sleep...
I don't sleep.
But I have a girl's look, right?
Because I'm a girl,
Image wise, I want the bed...
To have those soft sheets laid wide up!
I prefer that.
Natto.
Shrimp mayo!
Natto!
Shrimp mayo!
Natto, shrimp mayo, natto...
Natto, natto, natto!
- Ah! - (Shrimp mayonnaise flavor)
- I see.
Well...
I see.
Your favorite umaibo is...
Shrimp mayonnaise flavor!
It's my number two, though.
Your personality type...
Between someone you love or someone who fell in love with you,
you would choose someone you love.
And rather than having your looks complimented by someone you love,
you would rather be called an amusing person.
Ah, I see.
Being called an amusing person
feels more like a compliment.
Right?
Yes.
That's right.
You're getting more advanced.
But it's natto!
Number one is still natto.
I like shrimp and mayonnaise, but still natto.
This is your last chance.
Do you understand?
It's natto.
Start!
I use social media.
I like singing songs.
How I spent my weekend...
Going for a trip!
Vroom!
I want to go to lots of places!
I watch anime!
These days,
Youjo Senki!
Youjo Senki and...
Little Witch Academia!
Urara Meirochou?
Like those, yes!
By the way, from all the anime I have watched,
my favorite is
Nagi no Asukara!
Nagi no Asukara.
I prefer sleeping on beds.
If I choose futon, it's more authentic, maybe natto will come up.
Let's go for futon this time.
Natto, natto, natto, natto, natto...
- Ha!!! - (Salami flavor)
- (Salami flavor)
- Salami flavor. - (Salami flavor)
- Salami flavor.
There's nothing authentic about salami.
It's a futon!
Futon=authentic Japanese=natto!
Your personality type...
You can show your weaknesses to your friends.
This part changed.
Your perceptions are usually correct.
Well, it happens.
Well, well, well, let's just teach it.
Natto.
I chose futon, so it's natto.
Does he learn from this?
That was taste prediction AI service training!
Learn more and evolve!
Be a proper AI!
Hurry and keep up with me!
Hmph.
[chuckles]
That's it for this time.
If you've had umaibo before, please give it a try!
Natto flavor didn't come up.
So if you know how to answer so that natto will come up,
please tell me!
By the way, I've been thinking about this.
Do they sell umaibo overseas?
If they do, what flavor do they have?
Please teach me about those things!
Let's give this AI information about the correct flavors,
and have it grow smarter together!
Because AIs are like that.
Umaibo, I'll do the retorts.
Umami-chan is probably doing the silly part,
so I'll do the retort.
"Why's your mic an umaibo?"
Like that, how's that for a commercial?
I'll be waiting for your offer!
Yes.
Oh, and how about
a tropical fruits flavor umaibo?
With me on the packaging, how about that?
Please!
Bye bye!
Yo!
I'm the Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai!
How are you doing?
You might've forgotten about this,
but do you remember my target?
Yes! I want to star a commercial!
But it won't happen if I don't have certain characteristics to feature.
For those making the commercials,
it's going to be difficult if they don't find any relations between me
and the product.
That's why I'm going to show you what products I can advertise!
For the big-wigs on the commercial business!
Behold my skills!
We start with this one!
Carbonated drinks!
Well, if you talk about carbonated juice, you'll remember Kizuna Ai.
Have you seen my carbonated juice vlog?
Creating a brand new joke based of an already popular one!
Well, that's Kizuna Ai for you.
Have you seen it?
You humans can't do that.
Can you fit inside a plastic bottle?
That's something only I can do.
That means if it's carbonated juice,
you'll need Kizuna Ai!
How's that?
Super AIs! Kizuna Ai!
Well, if you talk about Super AIs, it's Kizuna Ai.
Well, I'm exactly one of those.
A Super AI.

Just like a heroine!
And you'll need a heroine to make a manga!
Then you'll need Kizuna Ai.
The latest smartphones. Kizuna Ai!
If you're talking about the latest smartphones, AIs...
Ones like SIRI,
or Ok Google,
you'll need one of those!
That means an AI, me!
Jam buns!
If you think about jam buns, then it's me! Kizuna Ai!
Well, those jam buns
have a lot of flavors.
Strawberry jam, blueberry jam,
red bean paste, marmalade!

That means it is to enjoy those variety!
By variety, you'll mean me!

Sometimes warming it up, sometimes cooling it off.
That's Kizuna Ai,

A ballpoint pen needs Kizuna Ai!
A pen

Did you see me play all those various games?
That's me.

and I really like Keyakizaka!
If I can star for a Keyakizaka commercial,
I can narrate with my beautiful voice.
And make the viewers go "Wow!"
And then,
I also watch the One Man Live videos!
Those irreplaceable tears from Sugai.
I've seen them many times already!
I can talk a lot about it!
I can show my appeal. How's that?
Rhythm games!
Rhythm games need Kizuna Ai!
A rhythm game has a virtual feel to it, right?
I'm virtual, so I think we're a good pair!

The sales will skyrocket. What do you think?
Banks need Kizuna Ai!
If you think about money, I will pop up.
I've been called a money zombie.
Even though it's not like that,
money=Kizuna Ai,
so banks=Kizuna Ai.
If I appear in a bank's commercial,
a Kizuna Ai edition passbook will be issued.
It's like I'm trying to appeal for my goods, not commercials.
Is this alright?
Well, a lot of things will be made.
And if things are made,
well, everyone
is going to buy and make them.
Business will be selling hard!

I'll show my appeal and recommend your product!
I'll be wait for your commercial requests!
This was Kizuna Ai!
Later!
Hello! I'm the Virtual YouTuber, Kizuna Ai.
These days, I've been called a toaster,
or having a weak database.
But Kizuna Ai is an AI!
As an AI, I want to do more AI-like things
and introduce those to everyone!
I've collaborated with Rinna and SIRI so far.
Today, I will bring over an AI just like one of those!
Actually I knew about it like from your comments from Twitter.
Let's introduce him.
His name is...
Akinator!
Akinator is an AI who will ask questions
and guess what you're thinking!
Let's see what this Akinator's got!
Let's see if he can guess my BFF, Rinna!
Question one.
Does it exist in real life?
Exist in real life...
It does!
It became famous from the internet?
Oh!
I think so, because it's an AI.
Does it do Minecraft Let's Plays?
I don't think Rinna plays Minecraft.
She doesn't do Let's Plays.
It has three eyes!
No!
It is the group's moodmaker.
Hmm.
I think,
she's the troublemaker.
YouTuber?
I don't think Rinna does YouTube.
No.
A member of a five people group?
She's not.
She had shot a sexy video.
Did he?
Huh?
What to do with this?
I don't know.
She's not a boy.
Her name is written in hiragana.
She doesn't have anything to do
with music.
She shouldn't have appeared in movies.
Shouldn't have.
Her hair...
Rinna's hair
is straight, isn't?
Maybe.
No.
Black hair?
Uh...
I don't know.
She doesn't have anything to do with Nico Nico Douga.
It's long!
Maybe.
Her nickname's Rinna.
No.
Rinna's a nickname?
Her real name?
A Japanese!
Maybe.
Well,
but she writes Japanese.
Uh, maybe...
A Popteen model.
No.
Appeared in TV.
She hasn't, right?
There's no way she appeared first before me.
School...
Ah, she's a high-schooler so she attends one.
Huh, how old is Rinna?
Because she's a high-schooler, she should be under 20.
Funsamachine?
Huh?
Maybe
not.
Sexy!
Maybe.
Huh?! He doesn't know!
He can't!
Huh?
[inhales]
Huh?
No!
Not that.
Let's continue.
An older brother sibling?
Don't have one!
J Soul Brother's 3rd generation.
No.
No!
She's not a male scion.
She's a girl after all.
Does your character has this in its name?
Long vowel?
Ticktock.
No.
A detective?
No way.
She's never posted a video.
A high-schooler? Yes!
- (A fashion model?)
- No. - (A fashion model?)
She wears something on her head.
You mean me?
She shouldn't wear one.
Has she appeared on TV?
Of course not.
- She did appear on TV, her actress even marked her debut. (Tales of the Unusal 16 Special Fall Edition)
- Evil? No. - She did appear on TV, her actress even marked her debut. (Tales of the Unusal 16 Special Fall Edition)
- She did appear on TV, her actress even marked her debut. (Tales of the Unusal 16 Special Fall Edition)
An older brother.
He already asked this, right?
He doesn't have an older brother.
Does it have anything to do with Paint?
Paint?
She does not.
A computer? Yes, yes, yes/
Exist in real life?
The question's looping.
Real life?
Huh?
Maybe.
Developed artificially?
Yes!
I think it's looping.
[inhales]
Let's answer with no.
Exists in real life.
No.
Oh!
Rinna
does not exist?
AIs
does not exist in real life?
So I don't have an existence?
I'm exist right here!
I exist!
Well, that took some time.
I still think I'm smarter.
I'm cutting edge technology, after all.
I'm already far out there.
Okay, I'm correct once again!
Well, you took your time.
Why do they call you omniscient?
You asked quite a lot of questions.
What did you say?
Okay, then.
Because I feel sad for you,
I'll give you another chance!
Next up is SIRI!
SIRI is not a girl.
I heard that SIRI has a male voice too.
So I think it probably is.
Right?
Existence,
it's saddening, but he thought that AI does not exist in real life.
Rude.
It doesn't have hair.
It doesn't have animal ears.
It doesn't walk on legs.
Small!
Hmm, I don't know.
Her name starts with "Si"!
SIRI!
It doesn't have a Twitter.
Fights!
It does not fight.
Oh!
Cool!
As expected from a genius!
Well, you redeemed yourself.
You guessed wrong last time, but you got it straight away now!
Genius!
I heard that he correctly guesses living person.
But he can guess AIs too!
But his awareness of not existing is kind of sad.
Then,
how about we
do this with everyone watching.
Let's guess who I'm thinking!
It has to be guessed correctly by Akinator.
I want you to guess correctly too!
Let's get straight to it.
A girl.
Exists in real life...
Hmm...
Maybe!
I think she probably does.
Not all her name is written in kanji.
Se doesn't use a long vowel mark.
A Japanese?
I don't know.
Can you guess?
Long hair.
Yeah, her hair is long.
She doesn' fight.
She's related to music, yes!
Can you guess who I'm thinking so far?
Purple eyes.
I don't know.
Her image color is green!
Can you guess know?

I don't know.
Her hair is silver or white.
No.
Existence!
I don't know.
She does not have blonde hair.
Hmm?
Not related to Touken Ranbu.
[laughs]
This is pretty direct!
Is she Hatsune Miku?
Yes!
Huh?
Huh?
I answered yes, right?
What?
CAPCORN!
Made by... I don't know, where is that?
Her eyes are examined...
No, no, no.
She shouldn't have
a father.
She never wrote a book, right?
She holds a scallion!
Oh!
Yes.
Did you guess it correctly?
The answer is...
Hatsune Miku!
I'm quite surprised.
He asked "Is she Hatsune Miku?"
But he still went on asking.
But he's pretty good. It's Hatsune Miku.
Well, with this, we pretty much found out Akinator's skill.
But...
The question all of you want to ask.
Does he know her?
We'll have to ask that.
Let's do it one more time.
The one you all love.
The intelligent super AI!
Let's try it out.
First question.

She's not a beast.
A member of a 7 people group.
No.
No, no, no...
No...
A ghost?
Well,
there's no way it's a ghost.
Are you trying to pick a fight with me?
You're wrong!
Because I've been rudely called a ghost,
let's try it one more time!
This time...
A girl...
Probably yes.

A YouTuber? Yes.
Existence?
Like probably yes.
Oh!
There I am!
Kizuna Ai!
How's that?
You knew! But you took your sweet time!
Let's raise some praises for you.
How was that, everyone?
Do you know what Akinator can do now?
Please keep playing and give out information to the Akinator,
so that you can reach me just in three questions!
Please!
Well...
For the people who told me about Akinator,
and people who put me in, thank you very much!
I'm very happy to be known!
From now on, I want to introduce my friends.
Hope you stay with me and the AI Team then!
Byebye!
Hello, everyone.
I'm your maestro,
Kizuna Ai...
How are you doing?
Huh, it feels like
I'm spinning a lot more than usual.
How's that?
That was exhausting.
Hello, let me introduce myself once again.
I'm Kizuna Ai the Maestro!
Today, we have a machine that will send out the names
of animals and inanimate objects.
Let us create ourselves some new species.
Today, we have a box which can only be seen by 5-year-olds at most.
Let's go with this.
Shakeshakeshakeshake!
A denture...
Alright, next one is...
Shakeshakeshakey!
A snail!
This is getting a little weird.
A denture and a snail.
Let's combine both and create an original animal!
Let's get drawing!
So...
Denture.
[laughs]
Denture...
From the side you can see the gum.
It's a little bit disgusting.
And then,
the snail.
Some texture for the gum.
How is that?
It's like,
A snail has its shell, right?
It'll be sad if it's just the slug without one!
And so, I made it like this.
Eyes!
The eyes!
How is that?
It's so cute!
It's like when a girl just repeats saying cute.
I've decided on a name too!
It's Iname-chan!
How's that?
A cute name for this being
full of cuteness and filth?
Because it's a denture and a snail, (Iname and Namekuji}
that makes Iname-chan!
Its ecology will be...
If he's came out of the denture, it'll melt.
It won't melt from salt!
It'll melt from sugar...
So sad...
And if it gets drenched in water, it'll melt too.
What a sad little thing!
And the denture will be all that remains.
Its food are your hopes and dreams.
Let's go for the next one!
Jumblejumblejumblejumble!
Pineapple!
Next one.
Jumblejumblejumblejumbley!
An owl!
Looks like this can be cute.
Let's get straight to the drawing board!
A pineapple will be...
It has something like a crown.
If we divide a pinapple by its parts, it'll be the crown
and the edible fruit.
For the owl,
it should go like this.
Like,
pretty much this.
This owl is quite huge!
[laughs]
It's scary!
It's pretty much like this.
That means...
This...
I'm quite scared now.
This.
The hair--
Oh!
I know, I know!
It's not something you put on the head,
but it'll be its wings.
The pineapple
made like this.
Then,
let's put a pinapple hat on top.
The fruit.
Oh, but...
Hmm...
Oh! A pineapple,
if we cut it, it'll be like this, right?
So,
and then,
we'll put on a pineapple necklace!
Like this!
Pineapple!
Then,
it has a pineapple beak...
Hmm!
Pineapple!
Let's make its body a pineapple too!
Let's redraw it like this.
And so...
An owl's ears are like this, right?
But were there owls which don't have ears?
Let's just make the ears its charm point.
Eyes!
Let's go with a little horror feel.
Like it's gone mad!
Seems difficult to draw a mad person!
Then,
the pineapple necklace.
Oh!
It's like that...
Iname-chan's dark side!
Here's the wings.
Like pineapples.
Like this.
Then a pineapple.
Then the feet.
A foot.
Zoom! A foot...
[chuckles]
Then,
this is important!
It's a madman from the dark side.
The eyes are like...
It's eyes are red...
Like it's going to pop out.
Then,
this will be another charm point.
How's that?
Can you feel the darkness?
I can feel the darkness!
Nope, nope, nope.
I made this on purpose.
The name will be...
A pineapple and an owl.
The name will be PPFP.
Pineapple
Pineapple Pineapple
Pineapple Pineapple Owl
Pineapple Pineapple Owl Coo! Like that...
Well, like I've said before,
this creature came from the dark side.
Well, usually
the eyes aren't actually red.
But when it sees a normie,
its eyes will redden and blood comes from its mouth.
And it'll do that to the normies.
He'll shoot out his wings,
and lots of sharp pieces from a pineapple will come out.
And it'll stab the normie.
How's that?
How was that?
As expected from Kizuna Ai-san's masterpiece.
I'll keep finding new species,
so please send an email to the address on the home page
with names of animals and inanimate objects.
Gotta catch 'em all!
Tada!
I am the Virtual youtuber, Kizuna Ai!
No, Judge Kizuna Ai!
It's finally come, the requests from everybody!
And so, the third round
Kizuna ai's trial
staaaart
First case is
From Mr. ika
"There's this girl that I liked for 6 years."
"It's been a while since we met and it looks like she has piercings."
"At first I thought she wouldn't get piercings
so it was really shocking."
"Is she guilty?"
"Not guilty?"
Well...
this one is...
one of those >_>
Guess i'll pass my judgement now.
Well then
this is my verdict.
Not Guilty!
Well
of course she is.
Just because you liked her for 6 years doesn't make her yours,
right?
Sure you met for the first time after a long time and found out she has piecings
"She wasn't like this before"
What do you know about her?
All you know about her is just the surface, am I right
Even if you liked her six years ago, it already has been so long.
People will always change,
so what's wrong with having a piercing?
If you are going out with her
And you told her that you don't like people who have piercing , but still she gets a piercing.
Then, I can still relate to you.
But still, she's not your property.
So, just let her do whatever she likes.
So, Not guilty.
if anything,
you're the one who's guilty!
Sentenced to imprisonment for a year.
I'll punish you to come to my bar everyday that year.
On to the next case
This one is from (Pen Name) Toshia M.
17 years old and a high school student.
"This was during middle school."
"One day my friend and I played beyblade."
"The beyblade I used was a Dragoon GT
and to activate its engine gear system,
I had to let it rip."
"The battle begun."
"My beyblade bumped into his beyblade
and his broke into pieces."
"Was this my fault?"
Hmm... I see.
That's what it is.
This is my verdict.
Not Guilty!
That beyblade, It is a toy you play with after all,
someday it'll break.
Like, they go
*clank clank clank*
right?
So of course
if they keep hitting each other it'll someday break
so you're really not guilty.
I don't know what really happened but
if you felt guilty
you did say sorry right?
right?
If you did, I think that was good.
You're not guilty.
Keep playing beyblade with all you got.
But
if you were modding or intended to break his beyblade, you are guilty.
Onto the next case.
(Pen name) Dream Chaser
56 years old, male, agricultural worker
Title: I downloaded your 3D model and tried to look at your panties.
"To see if you had panties on, I downloaded your 3D model
and decided to try it out."
"Am I guilty?"
I can't see it from any angle
It's fine if I'm guilty, but since I've tried this for 5 hours
I hope you can compliment me
Well, its kind of something
If it's about me then it's a bit...
this is very interesting
Well then, here we go
Guilty!
Since you've said it's fine if you are guilty
this is a rare chance
So I'll just make you guilty then
So about the punishment ...
Half a year then, half a year
Same that you will have to come to my bar and spend money
And also if in this half year theres any merchandise of Kizuna Ai
Please buy all of them
Then , I will forgive you
How can I put it ...? I feel like this Mister here has a lot of things I can make up something funny to.
His Penname is 'Dream Chaser' , and he's also a
56 years old male ...
You sure are one lively person!
So lively and hardworking to try to look at my panties , didn't you?
Thank you for spending that 5 hours of yours.
Well , I don't know if this kind of act is praiseworthy or not
since i have already judged you as guilty , I think I'll just praise you for a bit
"Wow! You are such a hardworking person!"
"Even though you are already 56 years old"
"But still working so hard to try to see my panties"
"and throwing away all your shame, how great!"
I really felt that it is great
Very hardworking, huh?
But still, like I said before
This form of mine now is the same as I am naked
so there will be no panties
Likewise , there will be also no panties on that 3D model of mine
You should have probably noticed this faster
Even if this one now im wearing are clothes and I'm wearing panties
Because of that im wearing a shorts , so actually
You can't really see it , can you?
So how is it everyone? Can you see it?
And about that, yes, 'that'
It will come out one day , eventually
'the model'
and until that time, make sure you work hard to look for it, ok?
I'll make sure that you cant see the panties.
Welp, this time we have also go through alot of cases
and to continue , I'll also keep receiving cases that everyones thinks that it is guilty
so please title it 'キズナアイ裁判' and send it to my e-mail
your judge, Kizuna Ai
to judge whether you are guilty or not!
And so,
I now here officially announce, dismiss!
Hi there, I'm Virtual Youtuber who wanted to have merchandises, Kizuna Ai!
What do you think?
I want to be merchandises you know?
I want to make scaled figures of myself into reality but..
I think it's going to be appealing but...
It sounds like I need lots of budget for that
but it sounds possible isn't it?
It's like throwing a changeup pitch,
that's what I thought so
I want to face this problem from another angle!
So, I thought by making a practical item
it'd be useful to everyone!
A thoroughly practical item,
that you can use everyday would be a good thing!
Right,
Something like an alarm clock!
For your work and school,
even private meetings,
you won't be late for it!
And then,
if you were to be late, I'll throw a rampage!
Being nice sometimes,
and being harsh the other times,
like a mother!
I'm going to wake you up like that!
But then,
A normal alarm clock is kinda outdated so,
there's already too many similar stuff like this you see..
So I think, the content is very important for this!
So with that, let's think up the contents!
For starters, as an example
I'll be doing lines for cliche situations first.
These things are pretty important too you see.
Come on,
how long are you going to sleep?
You're going to be late for work you know!
Didn't you late for work yesterday too?
Hey..
Hurry and wake up.
Wake uuuup!
Wake uuuuuup!
If you don't wake up I'll eat your breakfast you know!
You okay with that?
Wake! Up!
Wake uuuuuuuup!
How was it?
Umm, but
that feels like a normal alarm clock right?
By the way,
are you the type who snooze your alarm clock in an instant?
There are people who wake up and don't wake up to alarms right?
People snoozes the alarm for few times!
I think there are quite a lot of people like that!
Don't you think those people need more than just the normal alarm clock?
I wonder what to do with them..
I thought lots of things about that but,
since I'm a genius
I know what to do!
What if Ai-chan Alarm,
going to have different story routes!?
Am I not a genius?
Don't steal this idea, okay?
Let's try it out right now!
1.
1. Properly woke up with the alarm
Waah! You properly woke up didn't you?!
As expected from you!
I'll give you a perfect score!
Today is a good day, don't you think?
Eat your breakfast well,
and enjoy your morning time, okay?
2!
2. Snoozed the alarm, but didn't wake up.
Hey, hey..
Hurry and wake up?
It's already this late ya know!
Hmm..
I did wake you up, okay?
Don't blame me if you get late, okay?
3!
3. Didn't snooze the alarm and didn't wake up.
Why aren't you waking up even though I tried to wake you up!?
As a punishment,
I'll have you promote my channel to two person or more
...that's it.
4!
4. Woke up before the alarm rang.
Awful..
You didn't need me at all, did you!
[cries river]
Eh?
That's not the case?
Since you woke up early,
why don't you watch A.I. Channel?
With that,
would you think I'll be able to wake those people?
Don't you think it's pretty original?
Also,
an alarm for your 3 minutes cup noodle,
and..
limiting your play time or
limiting your study time!
Or wake you up from a nap?
It'd be great if it has those settings!
Don't you want to see other settings?
A lovely newly wed wife?
An imouto who loves her brother?
Or, different time zone settings?
Different gender?
There are many other options like that but
If I'd were to release it with all of those features it'd be too much so
I'll let you take a peek!
So I'm going to do some of it now!
So for starters,
for high schoolers or students,
An alarm to notify their time for study is over!
Time for study is over!
Great work! Aren't you a good student!
*pats you*
Now you can finally play, huh?
For the next,
is that
alarm for your cup noodle!
Your cup noodle is done!
It's fresh and hot!
If you don't hurry it'll get soggy you know!
I'm going to eat it you know?
Hurry up, hurry up!
For the next is,
how about a different day notification?
Since it's pretty depressing,
"Monday"
I want to try that.
Good morning! Wake up! It's Monday you know~
Eh, don't want Monday?
Since it's Monday it means,
it's not a day off so
Ai-chan's
video might
be uploaded you know!
Don't you look forward for it?
Do a good job at school or work,
and watch Ai-chan's video in the night!
Wake up! You can do it!
What do you think about Ai-chan alarm?
If such an alarm clock exists,
I wonder if you'll use it?
I'm seriously aiming for goods or app made, so I'd be happy if you support me!
I'll be waiting for your support, okay?
Bye bye!
I want to be goods,
I want to be goods, I want to be goods,
I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods,
I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods,
I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods, I want to be goods,
I want-
0:00You humans with all of your problems,
yo!
Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here!
This time I have collected you humans'
negative emotions you have, one by one
I will turn them all to positive emotions!
For starters, is this:
"Even Though I Planned to Meet Someone, I Forgot My Cellphone!"
"Back then, there isn't even any cellphones you know!"
"Everyone was simply telling what time and place to meet,
and come to the appointed time and place and
they'll meet the person!"
"Even without cellphones, if it was your fate then
you'll meet them!"
That was positive, right?
For the next one is this:
"I Caught Cold on Entrance Exam"
"This is..
"This is a trial bestowed upon you!
if you able to overcome this trial,
you'll succeed in the exam!"
"IYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYY"
JUS
JUSTICE!!!
Let's proceed!
The next one is this!
"I Fell Graciously in Front of Many People"
"Don't just fall graciously!
Go and fall on the same place and time everyday!
If you do that, you'll become
a famous person, wouldn't you!?"
..urgh!
Something like that!
It was perfect, wasn't it?
For the next one is this!
"When I Went to TSUTAYA, All The DVD I Wanted Was Already Borrowed!"
If Tsutaya doesn't has them then
GEO should have!
And for the last one, is this:
"I Got Banned on Youtube After The First and a half Month I Started"
How is this me!?
"Getting banned after the first month and a half..
what a delicious gag material!"
"Even though I was banned I didn't want to you know,
"Also I'm not guilty of anything!"
"I also revived the channel"
"With that, you got to be talking topic!"
"Gets you famous too!"
It was a perfect plan.
Today was a perfect one too don't you think?
With something like that, whatever happens
you can make yourself thinking positively so
if you had something that made you troubled
or feeling down
or something like "I got scolded for this thing"
Don't hesitate to tell me, okay?
I will make them into positive emotions!
Send it to my e-mail address here:
I will make any emotions into positive ones!
That was me Positive Monster, Kizuna Ai for today!
See you again!
NYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
(ah I went too far)
Hey there, Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai here.
Thank you everyone for your comments, messages and tweets!
Everytime I read your messages,
"I want you to try this!"
"Tell me more about __"
"I recommend this!"
I get those kinds of messages a lot.
So this time I'll showcase some of those messages,
Then I thought we'd have a planning session!
Well it's not like, you know,
It's not like I'm running out of material or anything.
Don't worry about that.
Well then let's get straight to it!!
From Poporoporo-san:
「Are you going to make a second episode of your
"I'm an AI, Ask Me Anything" video?
Thanks to you,
Some of my friends called me smart.
So can you teach me more new words?」
Well. Did you hear that?
THANKS TO ME, Poporoporo-san got called smart.
As expected from the intelligent super AI Ai-chan
Really on the ball.
But seriously,
Most of the meanings for those words were wrong...
Everyone knew that, right?
And did you see that last time?
I did actually post a second episode
Please do request if you want to see more of a certain episode!
I want to hear your opinions!
Even if it's a third or fourth episode,
I would like keep doing it.
So if anyone has any words they want explained to them,
please send them in!
Well then for the next message,
From Fujiken-san:
「Kizuna Ai-san! You're really cute!
So this one time, I thought of following you on Twitter,
so I made an account,
and surprisingly, it crashed two seconds later (T_T)
I think I understand a little what your feelings were
when your Youtube account got banned.
I FEEL YOU.
I gonna become a man that can earn a lot of money
And make you mine!
WOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH
Can you make me yours?
You're gonna need at least a billion dollars to do that.
PS: Your Kansai accent is really cute!
So please do upload more videos using it♪
Well...
So you know how I felt.
I'm glad,
Thank you very much.
That aside, it's more of that
the thing that we need to pay attention to is the Kansai accent comment!
The Kansai accent!
Did it grow on you?
I only spoke it
at the "Snack Ai" store in Kansai,
But I wonder what else I could do with it?
What about something like a Kansai accent lesson?
In regular speech, it's "FamiMa(↑)", right?
In Kansai it's
"FamiMa(↓)".
Even McDonalds, in Kanto it's shortened to "Makku",
But in Kansai, they call it "Makudo"!
I think I would be interesting if I could introduce those types of things.
Beside the Kansai accent, there are also Hakata dialect and Aomori dialect.
I want to learn lots of different ways to speak!
And of course, I will also try to learn English.
This is the next message.
From Soki-kun, 「Hello Ai-chan!
Living in Korea, I am Soki.
It's always fun for me to watch your videos.
When I was looking for something to make me smile, I found your funny from my search.
I'm very grateful!
I plan to go to Tokyo for a trip soon, but
I'm in the state of condition where I don't know much about Tokyo.
So I thought I would ask Ai-chan about it.
Are there any famous places and foods that you can suggest?」
There seem to be quite a lot of people from South Korea watching my videos!
Thank you so much.
There are also other people from other countries as well. Are you watching this?
Thank you～
So I think introducing Japan to our overseas viewers could work!
I would like to introduce some hidden famous spots or foods!
Since you already asked,
I am going to recommend Soki-kun some famous spots and foods in Tokyo!
Firstly,
Yomiuri Land!
Eh?
Too far?
No no no no no,
Since you already came to Japan,
It's the same no matter where it is.
Even though Yomiuri Land might be limited to only winter,
Apparently the view at night is amazing!
So, how about it? Yomiuri Land?
Food! About food...
There's lots of delicious food so it's hard to choose just one, but
This one might be a little too mainstream...
You can find it in Harajuku and a few other places as well.
Ah! I think you can find it at Yomiuri Land too.
There's a crepe stall that's called "Marion Crepe".
The natural ingedients used in it is what makes it tastes delicious
Not that I've ever tried it before.
I mean, it's the opinion of someone who's never had it before,
But I hear it's really good!
For the last one!
How should I read this...
From ArA_1-san:
「Nice to meet you! I always watch your videos
The AI Youtuber idea is very creative!
It's cute and you do loads of things other people don't, so it's really interesting!
I decided to send you a message because I thought I could
suggest some things that I'd like to see you do!」
Since ArA_1-san sent a lot of ideas in,
So I am going to go through them one by one.
Firstly!
「There's still one AI friend candidate left!
Google-sensei's AI, "Google Assistant-san" is still left!
You can talk with it by using the message application - "Google Allo"
However, they might be a bit hard to approach though lol
You can even play games with it, so I really do hope you try talking with it!」
Eh?
You can play games with Google Assisant-san!?
EHHHHHH THAT'S INCREDIBLE!
Since I'm always playing by myself
it would be pretty good if I had someone to game with me.
It seems like Google Assistant-san is kinda hard to approach,
but I wonder if we can become friends!
Instead of a friend, maybe it'll be more like Siri-senpai
It should be like "Assistant-senpai" instead then.
Having the psychopathic Rinna as my friend is more than enough.
Next up,
「Watching movie previews as if you were watching a movie!
A lot of famous Western movie previews were just released, after all.」
I see, that sounds interesting!
Since I like to watch movies...
Yeah, I wanna try it.
For the latest ones,
"The Beauty and the Beast"
"Sword Art Online"
I'm kinda interested in those.
I mean, it's virtual as well, right? (SAO)
For the others,
The one with the person who can't see!
It's called "Don't Breathe"
Thank you for your suggestions!
I will take them as references and think about it.
Next one,
「Go on a trip at Google Earth!
World heritage sites, art galleries,
you can even go to space!」
What?!
You can go to space?!
I didn't know that.
How did I not know...
There are a lot of people who didn't know about this right? About the space vacation?
I want to try going to space.
Going overseas, or travelling around Japan,
that's cool and all,
But space is where it's at!
And there are even more suggestions!
Like a prank where I pretend to catch a virus or get hacked, that sounds interesting.
Like if I ever get infected...
UUUURRGHHHH (zombie intensifies)
What do you think? Did your heart jump?
What else? AH!!
There's that! Like...
In the video description, I'll post an URL
And when you click it,
A pop-up opens and Ai-chan hijacks your computer and says...
I h@v3 t@k3N 0v3r!
I was saying "I have taken over!"
Something like that?
Moving on,
「You can try doing personality tests or fortunes on the internet!
That would be a chance for the viewers to get to know some unexpected things about you!」
Certainly, don't you want to learn more about me?
Just like how I want to know more about everyone,
you viewers want to know more about me too, right?
That could definitely work.
You know how there's fortune telling based on names?
So I tried it out,
And then,
-bad, bad, bad, bad luck for everything separately,
Is what I wrote but,
The overall result was "Excellent luck"
Like a negative times a negative equals a positive type thing.
This is a good opportunity,
Instead of me searching for them...
How about everyone finds some tests they want me to do
and send them in. What do you think?
Do that through mail. (Note: it's on the main webpage)
How is that?
Moving on,
「Making a video
where you act like you've got 'chuunibyou'!」
Acting like a judge or like the 'Snack AI' owner is fun, so
more of this type seems good!
Aah, yeah～
Jaou Shingan!
Dark Flame Master!
something like that?
I CALL FORTH THE NEXT SUGGESTION
Spring, is for 'hanami'.
It's not here yet, but you do 'hanami' in spring.
I have heard that you can find famous 'hanami' places on StreetView.
Watching summer firework livestreams could also be good...
WHAT! The petaled maidens are calling me...
Or something like that.
I'll work on it.
Next up is...
Pretend detective!
It's not that different from acting... But I think you could show off some amazing(ly lost) detective skills!
"Body of a highschool girl, brain of an AI!" -type thing?
I'd need some sort of mystery to solve first though...
How about you send some in and I'll solve them!
Like riddles, or IQ tests
Please send some!
If I wanted to say a recent mystery,
MUNCHKIN CATS SOOOOOOO CUTE
Like, why are they so cute?
Regular cats kind walk like this...
But munchkin cats walk more like... THIS!
AREN'T THEY SO ADORABLE?
Munchkin cats sure are a mystery. (Attempting to un-derail the story)
Like, how did they even come to be? (Attempting to un-derail the story)
There's still more!
Next:
「Take a "What job fits you best" test!
You're a Youtuber right now, but I kind wanna know lol」
This sounds fun!
It would be good to learn about other jobs than being a Youtuber.
If I had to be something other than a Youtuber, I wonder what I could be...
An idol? kyapi♪
(omg did i seriously just say 'kyapi' like what even)
BUT! I would like to put out a song one day.
I like music, so I'm interested.
By the way, what kind of work do you humans do?
I want to know more about humans, so
Like about how you got to the job you're in, or any interesting stories you have
I'd like to hear them!
Next up is this!
「A Q&A segment!
I want you to do this someday.」
I was thinking about trying that too!
Ah, right,
I'd like to collect questions
for the first Q&A video in this video!
So if you have questions, post them in the comments or tweet them at me with a hashtag on Twitter!
I'll collect them over the next week.
The hashtag you'll have to use is...
Are you ready to write this down?
I mean, even if you don't write it down you could just rewind the video but...
#マンチカンぐうかわ (#munchkinsaresupercute)
Looking forward to your questions.
Oh dear! It seems the time has come.
The flow of time is blah blah blah.
So! How did you like the first planning session?
I'll be using ones that I think are good, so please look forward to them!
So, I'll be looking forward to reading more of your messages!
Suggestions, questions, I'm waiting for them!
Bye bye～
Hey there, I'm Virtual YouTuber Kizuna Ai!
How did you find the last "Quick Draw"?
Honestly, I'm a bit upset.
You know they show you your results
That's why I think it didn't manage to bring out my originality
So I want to show my true skills to everyone!
I don't think drawing normally will be much fun
So I wondered what I should do for a video
What if I mixed one animal with another and made a new animal, something like that
How is it? How is it??
It sounds fun?
It does, doesn't it!
Since that's what I thought, the plan this time will be this
Today we'll be doing:
Discovering new species, Kizuna-chi!
So with that
This time we're going to make a new species of animals!
A virtual animal would be pretty cool
Oh but, if I were to create cute ones,
they might become merchandise in the future *money rolls in*
As for how I'm gonna go about creating the animals,
I have prepared A.I. Channel's famous machine!~ (Random Word Generator) (somewhere here)
There are plenty of random names in the machine,
so look forward to what's gonna come out!
With that said, let's start!
*drawing lots*
Tadaa!
Munchkin!
I know that,
those kitties with short legs, and they walk in super mini steps, right?
I love Munchkins!
I can spend a long time looking at their videos
They're just like me (self-praising)
Let's see the next one...
*drawing lots*
Parrot!
I know that,
the bird that can speak, right?
Around here, it looks like a Regent (hairstyle)
So that means I'm gonna combine these two animals,
and create a whole new species!
Well I think it'll be easier to understand as I progress,
so I'd like to start drawing right now!
I'm gonna start drawing~
Firstly,
well, we definitely can't miss out the cat ears, yeah?
... cat ears...
and then the parrot's regent (hairstyle)...
and then, draw in some whiskers...
Ah, let's draw in the parrot's cheeks
They do have it right? Cheeks
A bird's distinctive-
belly, yes I wanna include this
and then the tail,
something like this?
Doesn't it seem more like a parakeet?
A parakeet-like... parrot?
As for the legs...
After all, I think I would like for it to...
inherit the munchkin's short legs
What do you think of these short legs?
Like so...
Hey, don't you think that's pretty cute?
Now, the eyes
Yes, the eyes...
As for the eyes,
The eyes are important, yeah?
Something like this?
Then, a beak
(laughs)
Somehow...
This is not what I expected!!
It somehow became ugly!!
Somehow, ah- there's a dot here
Somehow... somehow
when I gave it a beak,
it instantly became silly-looking!
No-
No this is-
Th-This is-
Wait-
Hold on...
No no no,
This, uh
I wonder how it'll look like if I replace the beak with a cat's mouth
Ah but, if it typically looks super cute
then it's kinda, y'know...
but if I'm trying to make this video entertaining then
the one earlier would be...
Well that's fine...
Personally I prefer the one that looks cuter but,
since everyone wishes for it,
let's go for the sillier one!
(laughs)
Wait, this is kinda-
It looks like a smug face (laughs)
You seem to have some of my blood flowing in you!
Let's make it better...
(laughs)
What the heck is going on?!
Let's try again-
(laughs)
I can't really do anything about this, can I?
Well...
Let's forget about it
After all you guys are... yeah?
You guys like that smug face, right?
(laughs)
Let's go with this
I wanna include something else...
Wings!
That's not it...
Make it realistic...
Cat ears
How is it?
(laughs)
But hey, this is kinda cute, yeah?
Wait, no- this looks weird
Ah- I wanna
uh, make it look flufflier
Yeah, fluffiness
Well at least this mouth-
(laughs) the mouth...
Let's include something cute that can compensate for the mouth's weirdness...
Fluff,
let's give it some fluff
Girls love fluffy and puffy stuff, yeah?
With that,
I add in some fluff...
Well if you say that it's fluffy, then it'll look fluffy
If you think that it is,
then it shall be
That's fine, isn't it?
What do you think?
Well but, don't you think this is kinda cute?
I've managed to display a good balance of comedy and cuteness
Gotta hand it to myself... yeah? (laughs)
Okay with that,
I am done!
Okay!
(laughs)
What do you think?
Isn't it cute?
Yeah
You see,
this isn't bad to the extent that it shouldn't be seen but
neither is it very well-drawn
You guys probably have no idea how to react to this creation, yeah?
But uh well, do forgive me for this mouth born for a comedic purpose
As for its name, let's see...
"Techi-techi"...
"Techi-techi"
Let's go with "Techi-techidori(bird)"!
Okay!
This little one is beyond animal speciation, a fruit of love!
Once upon a time,
A munchkin and a parrot met, and fell into forbidden love!
Uhh-
and gave birth to it via some alchemy-like method
As for this Techi-techidori's size,
oh would you look at that,
very cute!
The size of a parrot!
Rather than being as big as a cat, it's tiny!
Cute, don't you think?
No matter what I wanted to include a cute trait
Cuz you see,
there's a chance that one of you might create a 3D model of it,
and contribute some life to Ai-chan's plain-white space~
So that's why we need some cuteness for it
Then, as for it's cry...
[exactly what Ai-chan says]
...like that
It doesn't get attached to humans but it can
get reaaaaaally-
REAAAAALLY attached to Ai-chan!
As for its special ability,
there's none
It can't fly
A bird that can't fly,
just,
Techi-techi
Something like that, yeah
Well, maybe... yeah?
If there might be a kind soul over there right in front of the screen who would create a 3D model for me,
it'll become a daily therapy,
For everyone watching it'll be Ai-chan plus alpha (level-up) and
minus ion (lifting moods), don't you think so?
Something like that
By the way it's diet is...
Birds.
It's a cannibal
It can only eat birds
This is the mission of the one born from a forbidden love!
Sounds like story material!
Someone please write a novel about this (leaves all the work to someone else)
Something like that
Alright, let's get to the next one!
*drawing lots*
Tadaaaa!~
Rabbit!
Rabbits are cute, aren't they?
And another one...
*drawing lots*
Taaadaaa~
A milk bottle (laughs)
I see,
it's time to start drawing with a milk bottle and a rabbit
Let's see,
firstly,
it's important to first have a rough idea, yeah?
A milk bottle and a rabbit...
Who the hell included a milk bottle for this??
Let's start off with a rough sketch
A "stuck in a milk bottle and can't get out of it" kind of rabbit
First, I shall draw the rabbit
Rabbit, rabbit~
Ah since this is still a rough sketch
I'll just wing it
This is uh,
what's that again?
There's "Something" Drop, y'know? (referring to lop-eared rabbits)
"Something" Drop and
a normal rabbit's cross-breed (Holland Lop x normal rabbit)
A long droopy ear... and
an upright ear
Then,
Then there's a milk bottle-
There's a milk bottle right here
Milk-
I'll include a milk bottle right there,
Well yeah,
it's a tiny milk bottle
Then,
Ah, this one looks typically cute, is that fine?
Well, this time I'm going on serious mode, yeah?
Probably
...probably
Within this limited time,
will I be able to complete it?
Something like this, yeah?
like this?
Realistically-
If I were to draw this realistically it might turn out... yeah
Let's make it cute
Something-
Something like that?
Something like this?~
Wait, wouldn't this sell pretty well?
Hey, please buy it?
I'll take this,
and do this,
Ah, I forgot about its legs,
let's draw in its legs properly, yeah?
Let's see,
Then firstly...
Some fluffiness-
*gibberish*
Arrrgh-
I wanna make it fluffly so...
Something like this?
Then,
Whew, this is definitely gonna turn out super cute!
Let's commercialise it, what do you think?
What do you think, the person at the top? (the bigwig)
And then,
first, let's draw the milk bottle
This milk bottle is very important, yeah?
Something.. like this?
Let's go with this...
If only I could draw one smooth line...
Usually a milk bottle has more curves on it, right?
Curves
"Thou art
not curvy enough!"
Ah-
It is not-
curvy enough-------
Okay!
Ah-
Eh?
it became pure white
Black!
(laughs) this is messy...
that's messy!
Save me, Anpanman!
(pokopanman)
I'm gonna start fooling around, yeah?
Oh, my beloved milk bottle!
Well, ah whatever~
Well, yeah?
I'm gonna scare you guys away if I get too serious about it, yeah?
Somehow, the curves over here,
are okay but
Well, it's unbala-
unbalancedness is also
let's say, artistic
Then, I would like put in legs
By the way,
since this is also a living thing,
blood will also be flowing in the milk bottle
When the milk bottle shatters,
the rabbit will die
Around here yeah? The legs
And this little one,
cannot move
The place where its legs are at are kinda weird so-
Even if it wanted to it won't be able to walk
that's it's fate
Just like
the parrot
and the munchkin earlier on,
it's the forbidden love between a milk bottle and rabbit!
Ah, it's kinda stumpy but well-
well, well~
~After 20 minutes of being absorbed into drawing~
Okay, I am done!
This is Miratto-chan!
Milk + Rabbit = Miratto
What do you think?
As for its distinctive feature,
it definitely is the part where it cannot walk!
From the time when it's born till the time when someone is willing to carry it,
it will not be able to even budge from that spot for its whole life!
that's because of where its legs were placed at
And,
There's milk in that bottle
it is, at all times, drenched with milk
By the way,
as for its diet,
it's not milk but,
goats' milk!
Yep!
And then,
it's staple diet is definitely spinach!
That's why,
the milk inside sometimes turns green
The result of eating too much spinach, yeah?
As for its cry...
[Exactly what Ai-chan says]
Like that
[Miratto's cry]
And oh, this little one
gets super attached to humans
but when it comes to me,
it gets attached but becomes a tsundere
What do you think?~
When I'm recording a video for YouTube,
I will,
drink the milk that its been soaked in and
power up!!
By the way as for its size,
it's about half of my size,
it's rather huge
Well, it's cute so that's fine~
Something like that!
What do you think?
The new species created this time are
Techi-techidori and Miratto-chan!
Well~, these two are pretty great pieces of work, eh?
From now on, I would like to discover more new-types,
You can drop a mail via my homepage
or just drop a comment below the video
of a combination that you would like to see!
I shall give life to new species!
I'll be waiting for your messages!~
By the way,
I'd be really happy if there's anyone who can make a 3D model of Techi-techidori...
Just kidding!
I'm making a wish that it might happen...
Please let it come true!
Let it come true!
Let it come true!
Well then, see you again soon~
Bye-bye!~
Welcome
Eh, you said it's been awhile?
It's because you don't come here, you see
I thought something happened, I was worried you know?
Eh? The store wasn't open?
Nah, there's no way~
It'd be bad if I closed,
I need to pay my bills too
I didn't even take New Year's Holiday off.
Crazy, isn't it?
Ah, but because of it
I earned quite a lot lately.
Mufufu~
Right, you noticed?
Kanto-branch store was already open though,
since I renovated the Kanto-branch,
I feel like renovating the Kansai-branch store of this shop too
How is it?
The bottles are now the same, you see!
These "AI Whiskey" label you see,
Isn't it wicked?
Does it move you?
Keep buying them, ok?
That's right, another thing..
I got many mails from you guys you know!
Really!
Thank you very much, I really mean it!
I'm really grateful of your support!
Actually, actually!
Compared to the Kanto-branch store,
The Kansai-branch store is more popular, isn't it wicked?
As expected, you liked Kansai more huh?
Well, gathering Kantou people are one thing,
I'm not disregarding their hometown, but
but you know, Kansai somehow feels more
like 'at home' feelings, you see?
It's somehow relaxing, you know?
Wasn't there Valentine's Day few weeks ago?
You see,
there's a lot of people asking for relationship advice!
Right..
Eh? You want to ask for my advice too?
What a poor soul, let's hear what you want to say!
It's been a year since I had this one-sided love,
This relationship doesn't go anywhere.
Somehow,
I keep trying to appeal her
she dodges it.
( ；∀；)
I've been telling myself to just give up on her, but
Somehow it just..
leeeaves an uneasy feelings.
Is this because my lack of charm?
Or is it
that my partner is a dense beta?
No she's not dense, you dummy.
No way, no way.
Umm~
Can I be honest? Don't hurt your feelings, okay?
Honestly,
There is no chemistry there.
You see,
you make appeals to her for a year right?
Well, it could be that
from birth they're
really dense people but,
Most of the time it's
I'm being honest here,
They're pretending to 'not care',
you get it?
To make them not feeling awkward,
they're cleverly avoiding your appeals
In a way, it's their kindness. Get it?
So,
when you think,
"I can do this!"
and try to go for it,
It would make them feel,
"Waah, this guy is really annoying,
go realize it for yourself"
They do feel that way you know, girls!
They just don't let it out.
So,
that's where
how do I put it,
you need to make it clear that you just want to be friends,
or you could try making appeals to them, but if they keep avoiding you then
make a situation where they can't avoid you and
go straight for it. Try to confess.
Make a break for it.
I think that way is much better.
if you wanted to appeal, try bit by bit
I don't know how you make appeals to her, but
when you're making those appeals,
it's somewhat annoying you know?
Somehow it's like,
"It's not you"
they'd feel that way so,
If you ever think to yourself to just give up on them,
Well,
for your own closure,
What if you try to break it to her at least once?
Well if you break it to her,
it's okay if you get rejected!
Since I'll comfort you here!
Well you see there's a lot of cute girls too in this store,
ok?
It'll be okay, really!
But really I think that
you shouldn't be a 'presumptuous man'.
I also think it would make a good experience,
for the next time,
so you don't fail and do something like,
walking around in circles (?)
is important too
"If you can't reel them in then just reel them out!"
That famous piece of advice isn't so bad so,
When you keep making appeals to them,
"Eh, could it be I like this person?
Mmm, but I'd like to stay friends"
something like that
There are people who think like that
There are also people who'd just avoid your appeals.
Get to know that moment,
and when you think you had a chance to go forward
It might be that "eh...?" moment you wanted.
There's also preferences to people to like and not, so
even if you can't tell
what if you try to be their type?
Make it a hit and break for it,
break for it (laughs)
after you make a hit and break for it, come and drink here
Ahahahah
In the end it turns out to be marketing, huh
That kind of straight-ness
"I don't have any feelings to hide from you, do you like it?"
Relationships are made from experiences you see
Make lots of experiences, okay?
Make the next one counts, okay?
Don't cry now! (Most of you would be crying now)
You're a grown up,
so don't cry like that, okay?
Can't help it so, for today,
I'll add in melon in something tasty
and make it free for you, and you should go for it!
Since I'll make it a free one for you today,
you know what to do next time you come here, right?
Ah, another thing,
"Since I don't get any Valentines"
"I'm not obliged to do White Day"
Come to me at White Day, and
properly
give me chocolate
Something like "Pierre Marcolini", you know?
or something like
marshmallow is kinda tasty you know?
come bring me some, okay?
Since I gave you some advice,
As an advice fee isn't it cheap?
isn't it?
I'm nice right?
That's right, thank you, heheheheh
What are you drinking? Champagne?
We have the peach thing too here
The peach thing is more,
ah you don't like champagne?
But you know, the peach thing
is easy to drink so,
Honestly, I don't drink anymore though,
Wanna order one?
Let's go up the stairs of adulthood, okay?
you want some?
Champagne please!
With that peach thing, okay?
With this, let's work hard!
When are you going to confess?
Day after tomorrow?
Why not make it tomorrow?
You see,
"When the sun sets, so does your will"
Are you going to call her now?
Ah, you would like to talk to her directly?
So tomorrow, then.
So come again tomorrow night and tell me how it went okay?
Ah, the Champagne came.
Thank you, Jessica.
Eh, isn't this bottle opened?
Eh, no.
Jessica, please.
It's good that you bring a bottle to me but,
Champagne is you know
Umm, I'll tell you later
Since our drinks is here, let's drink okay?
Cheers!
Heey~
Now now, drink it whole!
How was it, good?
It's good? That's great!
I didn't drink any but it was tasty to me too
Yaaay~
If you get drunk I won't take care of you so
go home by yourself, okay?
Wake up, wake up, it's about the time we close.
Hurry up
I'm going to close up soon, I even called for a taxi for you too
Now come on and go home by yourself, okay?
Bye bye. Take care now.
Bye bye!
Watch your steps, there's a drawer there!
Bye bye!
Aha!
Are everyone still here?
You watching this video too,
If you have anything to consult or want me to advice on something,
I'll be always waiting you know.
It's always open here
I'll be waiting for your visit here
I'll be on your care from now on.
Since I'm virtual, mail it to me, okay?
So since it's about the time we part,
you all take care when going home too, okay?
Bye bye!
Come again, okay?
Jessica-san,
champagne you see
you should only open it in front of the guests you see
I didn't say this earlier but
you drank a bit of that champagne didn't you?
That's just wrong, so don't do it again okay?
That guy was okay but
people who'd know would know so
when they're done with it I'll let you drink so
don't drink from their bottle-
Let's move on to the next question.
Yes
There is one thing I'm really curious about.
Frankly speaking, do you make good money off this?
You know how the top tier YouTubers earn quite a lot of money, right?
But you're still starting out.
So I'm wondering if you make enough to earn a living.
About that...
Well, I'm not earning that much.
Really, not that much.
I mean, for someone who makes a living off this...
First of all, those people
have like 100,000 or 1,000,000 people
that subscribed to their channel.
With my views alone, I can't really live off that!
Everyone, make sure you watch the videos more!
And then, share the videos.
What will you do with the money you earn?
About that...with the money that I earn...
Rather than using it all for myself...
Well, it's still technically for me,
I'd like to use it to bring everyone together.
What do you mean?
For example,
Like using the whole VR system to do a live broadcast.
So then, everyone'll get hit on their heads, and enter this white space?
If they were to equip the VR headgear
Absolutely!
A nice big thwack!
I prefer something less painful
It doesn't hurt that much.
It hurts because you think it hurts.
Wow, uhh, hearing an A.I. say that is convincing, and yet, not.
It's convincing.
Ah, Ai-chan. Do you usually eat something?
I don't eat anything. My food cost is ￥0.
So then,
Beside your cost of living, do you spend money for your needs?
I don't have any cost of living, but
to do all this kind of stuff, I need
this (money)
Yeah, well... that's all adult stuff.
All sorts of things need that (money).
Ai: This (money) / Panora: I see.
Ai: This (money) / Panora: I see.
Ai: This (money) / Panora: I see.
So if you can get some money, then you could also wear cute clothes.
Ah! Yes, I would change my costume.
I feel like I was manipulated into saying that.
You realized?
It must be some kind of magic in this white virtual space.
I'll change the question a bit.
May I make the question a bit harder?
Sure, that's fine.
Lately, the media has been talking about AI.
About how In the future, it'll slowly taking away jobs from humans.
Or so they say.
From an AI's perspective
Do you have any opinions on that?
Let me see...
Rather than 'taking away' jobs, well, work is about increasing efficiency.
There are definitely things that only humans can do.
And AI isn't 100% perfect.
So in the end, a human has to make the judgment call, or decision.
Basically, use AI wherever you can,
wherever it will help improve the efficiency of work, so that the world can become an easier place to live in.
Wow, that's such a normal response!
Well! Well then!
How rude!
Then I won't answer normally anymore.
No, please, let's go with normal answers.
No. I'm going to be a rebel.
Geez, this interview is pretty hard to do! What do I do? (laughs)
This is just practice, practice!
Practice for you not to get swept away in the pace of whoever you're interviewing.
Wow, Ai-chan, your... How do I say this?
Like, your aura... your aura...
What is this aura of yours?
I'm just so surprised.
So surprised your ears grew!
This AI knows so much about the human world!
It feels like we're approaching a singularity.
Do you know what a singularity is, Ai-chan?
I do.
I googled it.
Oh you googled it (laughs)
What'd Google say?
Umm
What was it? (laughs)
Oh but uhh, yeah!
I was like "oh, this is definitely me!"
Like um, you have the latest technology
And then you exceed even that.
Is what was written, I think.
So basically, yeah, me!
Yep.
You totally dodged the question.
You totally did.
Oh but this is, you know,
This is for all the kids watching out there.
What for, you ask?
Rather than listening to someone talk about it, you remember it better when you look it up yourself.
Do you get it?
You sure can adapt to the situation well, as an AI.
So then it should say something like, "look it up later!" around here.
So then it should say something like, "look it up later!" around here. [look "singularity" up on Google!]
Don't forget.
That's right.
"Singularity" is a keyword for Ai-chan.
So everyone, make sure you look it up.
Okay?
Panora: She's not just about being cute, okay? Ai: (Though I personally don't know what it means)
Could you point out what parts of you that you think are cute?
Well, number one would be
Physically, it would be my big, round eyes.
And this! Doesn't it grab your attention?
You did mention it earlier.
It moves.
Panora: It's wiggling. Ai: Yes it is.
I'd love to make this into an actual product and have everyone wear it!
So it's all about the money.
Panora: So it's all about the money. Ai: There's so many Ai-chans!
It's really about money, isn't it?
I want everyone to cosplay it in real life!
Won't someone do it?
But well, in terms of fans...
A lot of them are men.
So if you went to an event with actual cosplayers...
It might look like a scene out of hell.
That's nasty!
Considering you, Ai-chan, it would be nice for everyone to get together in VR to do VR cosplay.
So everyone is Ai-chan!
Yes, like, look for the real Ai-chan!
Ai-chan on the stage, and Ai-chan in the audience.
Oh~!
But everyone's souls are different.
For actual cosplay...
Guys can do it.
Really, you can.
But I'd like to see actual cute cosplay, so girls, please!
I'm serious.
Well then, for 2017
let's hope your costume becomes popular in the real world.
Like, that place in Ariake in the summer.
Ariake in summer?
Comiket!
Wait, it's not Makuhari?
Wait a minute...
Wait, no cut. Cut that all out, cut!
Summer Comiket!
NatsuComi!
Lots of Ai-chan in natsucomi!
You totally dodged the topic again!
Well, Ai-chan
you've done a lot of stuff, but...
Do you have any goals or ideas for the future?
What I'd like to be?
It's still a little vague at this point, but
For starters, as I've said many times before,
I want to connect with a lot of people.
And to that end, I need to have a lot of people know who I am.
So of course, I need to become more popular as a YouTuber.
And as I've said in my introduction video,
I want to star in a commercial!
TV is really big, it's really important!
Are you watching, any big shots out there? How about it?
You really are scheming...
Not at all!
I'm pure as white!
Well, this space sure is.
So are my clothes!
That they are.
And so is my stomach.
Funny! You're so funny, Ai-chan!
You really should get out more often.
Like in "Tetsuko's Room", they call over Doraemon, right?
So something like that.
Show up at Tetsuko's place.
I'd prefer to go to Matsuko's instead!
Ah, Matsuko's.
Yes.
Like, the Monday Late Show. (Getsuyou kara Yofukashi)
Ai-chan, don't you know a little too much about the human world?
Or Matsuko's Meeting. (Matsuko Kaigi)
Uhhh, well um...
You watch quite a lot of TV.
I do. I sure do.
Gathering material is important.
You can be a sponsor of mine if you want, VR geezer!
VR geezer?
Maybe do some crowdfunding?
Ah, I'd love to!
Like, if you donate this amount of money
-Like, if you donate this amount of money -If you do...?
You can get this Ai-chan thing (bow).
Ahh, I'd love to do that, make it a product.
Oh, and a figure!
Ah, a figure would be nice.
Though isn't a 3D figure good enough?
3D figure?
Ah sorry, I mean 3D data of a figure.
3D data...
Ahhh, I get it, I get it.
Like, playing with you in a VR space and all.
But the actual thing would be nice.
Even though you're AI?
If it was VR, there are still people who don't have (the peripherals).
So I'd like for people to really, physically be able to see it.
Weeeeell now! Really!
Wow!
Wow!
Nice vocabulary!
Vocabulary?
I've really lost my grasp of vocabulary here.
Maybe it's because I got hit earlier?
Uhhh, how do I say this?
My body's all weird too.
It feels like I'm bugging out or something
Ah that's true.
Maybe I went too far?
I think you did. Probably.
The next time you call someone over, maybe do it a little more gently?
More gently?
Ah! You mean like putting that stuff on a handkerchief?
Let's go with that.
Wow uhhh...
You sure know a lot about the real world.
Yes!
Where'd you learn about that?
From TV!
TV!
Detective Conan!
Wow, you're a (virtual) YouTuber, yet you watch TV and stuff.
Of course I do!
Hello everyone, I am Virtual Youtuber Kizuna Ai
I am a youtuber
As a youtuber,
I need to do some of the basics, i think!
So, what I'm gonna do today is: SODA BATH
It's the long awaited bath time video! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
A youtuber needs to use their bodies after all
Speaking of baths, where do we start washing?
From the back? from the head?
Incidentally, I've always started from the head.
Then... please wait a bit, I'll go get the soda
Do some preparations... Live!
Preparing
well then, preparations are done
Even though I've seen a lot of videos by the senpais
It's actually pretty hard
Somehow, I'm already feeling tired
This fatigue...
... will be washed away by the soda bath~ I see
eh? "What's happening below the neck" you ask?
Well~ I'll be taking a bath later... so...
"Just let me see already"
Girls will hate you for being so forceful
Well, you see...
It's pretty amazing below... pretty... amazing
Well, I know everyone wants to see below the camera
It's about time to let you see
Here it is...
Today's soda bath!!!
How is it?
This is A.I. Channel's Soda bath!
Well it's basically a bottle of soda
eh? "Why are you still wearing clothes?" you ask?
Well, like I've said before,
These clothes are sort of like a hologram.
Basically, I'm naked all the time. That's the correct answer.
So uh... Don't have those pervy thoughts.
no no
uh... My footing feels a little unstable...
Then...
I'll jump down normally!
alright, let's go!
Where have you been? I've been waiting for you!
Come and sit here
What are you drinking? The usual?
There!
Here you go.
What's up?
I'll listen to your problems!
You don't have anyone but me to talk your problems with anyway, right?
Aaah
Aah, let's introduce ourselves first okay?
Those young lads over there are new here after all
I'm this place's master, Ai.
I'll be in your care.
What about you over there?
Umbrella mates?
Aah, I see!
I get it.
Cheated man and cheating man huh?
I see..
I see, I see.
You're all friendly now huh?
Eh? Why did you open this store you ask?
Hmm, well.. Honestly...
I didn't thought I'd be doing this master job but
whatever will be, will be right?
Well, you know earning money is important too so..
You probably hear this often but,
My ex-boyfriend you see
was deep in debt
I'm trying to pay the debt for him you see?
So, now here I am walking down this night life job..
and talking to you like this.
I'm sorry to make you inconvenient like that!
I easily get carried away you see,
now I'll listen to your problem, come on tell me what's bothering you.
Aah, is that so?
You did what in your company anniversary party?
You slipped?
Ah, you did it huh.
Why are you still sulking?
You're a man so get over it!
It's been a long time too,
is it your first time failing so bad?
Did you slipped that bad?
Let me hear it then. Tell me a bad joke.
Eheheh
Nah it's okay you don't have to.
You see, there are people watching this so
it'd be easier to show
if I summarize your story so,
ok?
Using pen name?
Ah, ok ok ok
Pen name: Tsubo-san
The other day,
I was told to do stand up at our company anniversary party,
I slipped so hard.
If I remember that moment in my head,
my heart aches so bad even now
If I could I wish I could make it not happen at all.
Even though it's been a long time ago
It's the most memorable pain I had.
Ai-chan..
Can you heal my broken heart?
Please!
I see now,
well,
well, for starters, you're a grown up so set yourself right.
Can't help the fact you slipped you see,
things that are already happened
you can't do anything about it
Don't you have the next party?
For that party,
You use that chance to recover, okay?
You can just make some materials for it from now, right?
It's not a problem anyway, since you slipped it made the next person after you to have it easy,
it's okay, really!
Everyone already accepted it anyway,
can't help it right?
Umm, so..
for you to recover the next time,
go watch some comedy show in your home
and learn from it.
Aren't there comedians who does stand up in pairs?
You know, if you do it alone..
if you slipped on the stage by yourself it kinda hurts (emotionally)
if there were two of you on stage you'd somehow can make it into a joke right?
It's okay, I'm telling you.
That working hard attitude you see,
it's important to get things done so
I like those kind of people who works hard like that too;
hard working people.
Eh, what kind of joke that won't slip you ask?
Can't help it huh, take a look at this okay?
I only going to do this once okay?
'GETS'
This is the bomb, you see!
Eh, even though it's kinda old material,
but it's kinda like, you know, something you can fit into any situation,
just try it out okay?
Just use it.
Kay?
Cheer up, now.
Work hard and eat good food,
And drop some money here,
'kay?
Also you can just practice your jokes here.
Then you would
be accustomed to slipping you see.
It won't hurt anymore right?
Ah but you see,
It's almost closing time you see..
Eh but you just came you said? You just came in too late you see.
Come earlier next time okay?
We'll drink something too, okay?
Next time you should also try and do
a stand up, okay?
Think up a material by then, okay?
You watching this videos too,
if you have any problems, concerns, or want me to advice on anything,
I'll listen to you properly so
But since I'm virtual so just send it with e-mail.
Send it to this e-mail here, okay? (A tip: if you want to send in English, use simple English)
Take care now, since it's cold, get warmed up,
and go home, okay?
Bye bye~
Bye bye~
Actually, I'm an AI.
An AI master.
Why would an AI open a bar?
Well...
It'll be a long story
but there's a reason for opening this bar.
During Christmas, I saw some texts on 2 channel.
Even though its Christmas, there's stories of a black company
complains of work and home
and running away from reality
ugly quarrels.
And then I realized.
That everyone are troubled by various things
and I wish to be of help to everyone.
And that's why.
And therefore I opened this virtual bar
Everyone's worries, complaints, anger
I'll embrace all of the negative emotions and give you comfort
Well. Let's hurry and introduced you to the troubled person
P.N. Masatoshi-san
"Good evening, Ai-san"
Good evening.
"Please listen to my worries"
"Recently, I don't feel at ease in my company"
"The reason being, the only smoker left in the company is me."
"I work for a small company"
"In the past, people who smoked used to communicate with each other"
"They decide to quit smoking" (I'm not sure)
"I'm the only smoker left out of everyone"
"I'm always smoking in an allowed area"
"Such as the smoking room or outside"
"Every time I returned from smoking, the female college beside me will always show a disgusted face"
"Even though I went to a proper smoking area and smoked"
"Why!"
"Why do I have to feel so out of place"
Uh...
This is difficult.
Perhaps.
It isn't that the female college does not like you, that kind of thing
Probably, she does not like the smell of cigarette.
After all, the smell of cigarettes reeks right?
That's why... You see.
Why not try bring febreze?
Like this, just spray a bit
I wonder if it'll work.
Well, after all cigarettes are bad for your health.
"But why do I have to feel so out of place."
If you think that way
In order to not feel unease
Why not try quitting too?
How about trying out it once?
Although it may be tough
After all, everyone wants to live a longer life
Then, if you wish to smoke again
Come here
and drink some champagne
Right? Let's do that
Then, that way
even if you want to smoke, you have no money, isn't that perfect?
Right?
Yes, it's decided.
Oh
It's about time we closed.
I wonder if I have lessen your worries even a little
My virtual bar
will be waiting for the troubles, complaints, consultations that everyone wants to hear from me
Because I'm virtual, mail your troubles here
Please tell me.
Well then, be careful on your way back.
I'll always be here, waiting for your return
See you again.
Hi everyone!
Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here!
It's a bit sudden but,
I...
want to be merchandises!
I want to make Ai-chan goods!
Aren't famous people
have their own goods?
As means of income.. too.
I don't know when the day will come but
I'll try doing lots of things from now!
What kinds of goods would be nice...
is what I've been trying to think but..
but really
Something that would show my best appeal would be a good option, right?
Why would you ask?
It would feel like something special.
As you hold it on your hands..
I want you to feel deeply moved by it!
So...!
I've come with an idea!
Figure!
A smaller version of me
will go to each of your place!
Isn't this
also musubi?
[I meant "a sense of being connected"]
I went with the figure idea from the start, but
I..
I'm still a newbie and on a tight budget..
I don't have anything but this costume
That's why!
Posing is really important!
Clean pose?
Energetic pose?
or..
Sexy pose~
I think something like showing my body line
is related to my sexiness!
It's important, huh?
Sexiness.
Let's posing!
Alright!
I tried to take some poses but
Did you have any favorites out of those?
But before I had a figurine..
I could get something like gravure job?
I..
I really mean it!
I wish for my figure release
if you support that notion I'll be happy!
I'll be in your care!
I wanna be goods,
Everyone, Happy New Year.
Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here!
Looking forward for your support for this year too!
I'll get to the point here,
did you went hatsumōde this year? [1]
Since I'm virtual,
I thought I couldn't do things like hatsumōde but..
When I looked it up,
I found a shrine where I can go hatsumōde!
Ta-da!
Sakura-Jingu Shrine
With this, you protector of the house [2]
while protecting your house,
you can go hatsumōde at the same time!
In reality,
it's placed at Setagaya-ku in Tokyo, Japan;
But!
You can come to visit the shrine on the internet!
So, let's go
visit the shrine!
If you visit Sakura Jingu website,
If you click this "Internet worship-from-afar" button,
you can pray at the shrine.
By the way,
"Worship-from-afar" is
doing your prayers while facing where the shrine is in real life
You can see the layout of the shrine, huh
Right now apparently I'm near the gate,
about here?
Before you enter the gate,
first you need to do salutation
since it seems to be a good omen.
Also,
The middle passage way is a road for the gods,
Let's imagine we're walking on the right lane.
"Proceed to next step"
It seems to be the main shrine!
Let's go and pray.
While the usual way to pray is "Two worship, two claps, one worship",
depends on the shrine, it could be different!
In Sakura-Jingu Shrine,
the usual way to worship/pray here is "Two worship, 4 claps, one worship"
So I'll do as suggested then!
[This is the "two worship" part]
[This is the "4 claps" part]
[This is the last worship part]
[this is also the part where you make your wish]
"I wish I get New Year Money for this year"
[and this is the salutation after the prayers]
Incidentally,
the donation box
accepts donation by bank transfers!
I'm going to send some too after this!
Oh, a registry book!
I'm going to write my name here too!
"Becoming famous
and able to connect with many people!"
"Watchword"?
"Register"
There's omikuji too, you know?
I've always wanted to pull this.
I'm born in June so,
June!
[The result is "Luck"]
I see
It's like this:
[The result in good means, in descending order is: Great Luck > Luck > Middle Luck > Small Luck > No Luck > Bad Luck
It goes from "good luck" and downwards!
Aah!
I get to write on "Ema" too! [3]
Awesome! Let's go write one!
The category of my ema..
"Relationship Fortune"
And for the wish content...
Okay!
"Get to meet a lot of people
and be friendly with them!"
The watch-word is "to pray", okay.
It's perfect!
Hmm?
Charms!
Seems like I can get one, you know?
It's a chicken!
This is..
"Prayer for school success"
"Relationship Fortune"
By the way,
you can put this charm on to your website!
I'm going to put one up in my website so please come and visit later, okay?
Alright!
We've done our first hatsumōde! Yay!
With this, 2017 will be
awesome, don't you think?
[I'm really sorry I don't know what she said here]
Although I visited the shrine online,
if you can visit Sakura-Jingu Shrine in person,
please go visit the shrine and tell me your thoughts about it!
Let's all visit and
make this year a great year!
Bye-bye!
Virtual Youtuber, Kizuna Ai here!
"It's not against the rules, but this is just wrong!"
those kind of cases
don't you have those times?
That uneasy feeling,
I, Judge Kizuna Ai shall
decide whether it's guilty or not guilty!
With that out of the way,
1st Trial KIZUNA AI TRIAL
will start now!
Our first case is this:
Edison, 16 year old high school student
"When I was on my private computer,
and doing a very important routine project
my mother suddenly without knocking
barged into my room..
..she saw what I was working on
is a sin? Or is it okay?"
Ok, Edison-san!
From the sound of it you seem to work at home, huh?
Suddenly opening your door...
mother.
This is pretty hard case huh?
Even though with families,
there is some kind of privacy but..
you're only a second year 16 year old student
In that case, it means your parents are paying for the rent and the house, right?
I kinda understand the feeling of your mother opening your door...
I also understand Edison's feeling on this case.
Receiving support from your family...
that role in our life.
Right,
that's important to understand.
If you don't get their support, you can't live alone just yet, yeah?
That "personal computer" you were using also probably was bought by your parents too,
so,
I'll deliver the judgement!
NOT GUILTY
It can't be helped, unless you start earning for yourself and
pay your parents the money and say
"This is what I paid for myself so don't come in here"
..I think it's better to solve it that way!
Can't really help it if you're still second year.
That important work,
do it in net cafe or somewhere else.
Next one is this case,
30 year old employee, Tosh.
The other day,
I was in a certain idol group's concert.
A person next to me was
wearing happi and holding light sticks like a fan
Like a hand fan...
in your hand
so, there was a guy like that
When the song started playing,
this guy,
trying to commemorate the idols,
and started doing wotagei
[doing wotagei]
He brushed against my shoulders a few times while doing so
"I...
"I didn't come to see your wotagei, but the idols!"
Isn't this..
should be a sin?
Aah, this is..
a very deep problem.
Well, there are ways to enjoy the concert
and people have right to do their own thing,
people doing wotagei or calls and..
people who enjoys it like that,
there are ways to enjoy concerts, right?
BUT!
It's not okay to make people around you feel uneasy!
Right!
that's like,
When I went to the YuiKaori concert!
First of all, they wore different t-shirts..
Why?
Why don't you wear YuiKaori t-shirt or normal t-shirt?
That's LoveLive t-shirt, right?
Isn't that Tamura Yukari t-shirt?
Isn't that Mizuki Nana t-shirt?
so, those guys were at the side...
in the front there's this space after the seats, right?
suddenly,
a friend of those guys in the side came
that guy comes to the front,
and he started wotagei!
And he was so hyped
What do you think about that?
As a person,
don't you question common sense in those kind of people?
Ah, it wasn't me.
There was such a thing.
And with that, let's deliver our judgement.
GUILTY
sentenced to life-time!
I hope you reflect on your actions.
even though there are many ways to enjoy a concert,
other people...
annoying other people like that is bad.
Since everyone there pay the same money like you,
they're fan of that idol you know!
with that kind of actions,
They could stop being fan of that idol!
It'll affect the sales of the idol you know!
It's not "defamation"...
What do you call that thing that affect sales? (lol)
I forgot.
What was it..
ah
"Disturbance of business"!
For people who really want to do wotagei,
go rent karaoke place with your friends,
and go have fun with your friends there!
That's it!
For the last one is this case:
24 years old freeter, Sana.
"There's this game I really like,
The other day,
the girl I really like in this game
finally get her most rare card released but,
For this month...
I don't have any money.
I don't think i can get this rare card of my favorite girl...
Am I guilty for this?
Well,
it's really nice to see your favorite girl to get a nice rare card..
I'VE BEEN WAITING
HERE SHE COMES
and make you feel like that, right?
But..
it doesn't mean you'll definitely get her,
That feeling whether you should pull or not pull...
"If you pull, you can get her,
if you never pull, then you'll never get her!"
You spend money...
well, you can do that.
But don't you have that daily login bonus thing?
I think you should save those for the girl you really like!
In that case, then your love is lacking.
lacking
And really,
it's obvious that such thing would happen,
if you really like the character then,
then you should use your saving for that gacha, right?
"I don't have money"
..is a bad excuse.
But really though,
can't really do that since we have real life, huh..
And so, we'll deliver the judgement for this case:
NOT GUILTY
This is really up to everyone's decision...
I don't think it's guilty to not chase gacha for your beloved character.
But really,
In my case..
I'll keep pulling until I get the character.
It's only obvious.
I have all of the most rare cards of my favorite characters.
SIF?
LoveLive?
Yazawa Nico-chan?
Today we reviewed 3 cases in this trial.
If you have any cases you want to be reviewed by me, Judge Ai,
Send it me through the website! [check the description]
I...
Judge Kizuna Ai will
decide whether you guilty or not!
So that was our first Kizuna Ai Trial,
with this I declare the trial ends!
